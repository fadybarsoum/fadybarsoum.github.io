							<p>Fady is a technical power house who holds us all to a higher engineering bar. As
								many have said his ability to look around corners and anticipate technical
								challenges long before they're encountered is a tremendous asset on all the
								programs he's contributed on. Fady goes further and takes personal ownership
								of those challenges rather than deferring them to others.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="testimony-entry animate-box">
						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>As an anvil certifier, Fady is great at raising security concerns and effectively
								communicating potential risks present in a system. He is supportive of the
								development teams, providing resources and direction. Fady helped us
								successful certify a very large Anvils that consisted of 15+ services before our
								Open For Business cutoff.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="testimony-entry animate-box">
						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>Fady is a deep thinker that thoroughly thinks through every problem he is
								presented. He can see external elements or problems before they arise, and will
								always speak up when he sees them. You can almost hear the gears cranking in
								head when he is considering a problem and he always has great insight to
								provide.

					<div class="testimony-entry animate-box">
						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>Fady's superpower is the ability to deep dive and fix the root cause of issues,
								even for systems which he does not own. Besides numerous examples of this for
								runtime issues, Fady also demonstrates this capability in security reviews where
								he has identified real security issues.
							</p>
						</div>

					<div class="testimony-entry animate-box">
						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>Fady is a jack of all trades and somehow kind of a master of them all too? He's
								becoming a technical power house who can develop advanced systems at both
								the infrastructural and software level, can explain them effectively, defend his

								influence those around him.</p>

					<div class="testimony-entry animate-box">
						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>Fady working as a security certifier dove deep into the Sidewalk Cloud service
								and helped verify and close the security threats as mitigated. He took the time
								to learn and understand each service and identified several misses that even the

								security org to ensure the recertification captured data needed to close out the
								Anvil certification.</p>

							<p>Fady is a highly knowledgeable engineer and great at problem-solving,
								troubleshooting, identifying security risks, and thinking big! He has definitely
								demonstrated ownership while working on Janus, the Anvil certification,
								Architecture, and ORR documents thereof. He rose to the challenge and
								delivered high-quality results. He has earned everyone's trust with his deep
								knowledge and backbone.
							</p>

						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>Fady is a smart engineer. He's very knowledgeable on the products that he built,

								extremely helpful and his explanations and presentation skills for problems are
								elegant. Overall, he is a great engineer and leader.
							</p>
						</div>

					<div class="testimony-entry animate-box">
						<div class="feed-bubble">
							<p>Fady was extremely helpful when guiding me through the Anvil process. He has
